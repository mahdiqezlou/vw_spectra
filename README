Velocity widths

A collection of scripts for making and plotting spectral velocity widths from simulations. 
Depends on (and inherits) fake_spectra.

The main reusable classes are in vw_spectra.py and vw_plotspectra.py

The latter depends on matplotlib, the former does not. 

The files starting make_* are scripts for making specific plots for 1407.7858.
